# Veri-Sign: Blockchain Content Authentication Platform
## Project Report

### 🎯 Executive Summary

Veri-Sign is a comprehensive blockchain-based content authentication platform that creates a "Web of Trust" for digital media. Built on Algorand, it provides a two-tiered verification system that not only proves content authenticity but also establishes organizational credibility through credential-based reputation.

**Key Achievement:** Successfully implemented both Layer 1 (core authentication) and Layer 2 (reputation system) with a complete user interface, smart contracts, and browser extension.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The internet is flooded with AI-generated content and misinformation. Current solutions only verify if content is "real" but don't establish if it comes from a trusted source. There's no scalable way to distinguish between anonymous signatures and content from verified organizations like Reuters or Harvard.

### Solution Architecture
Veri-Sign implements an elegant two-tiered system:

**Layer 1: Core Attestation Engine**
- Any individual can create immutable, timestamped signatures for files
- Links file hash to wallet address on Algorand blockchain
- Provides base layer of authenticity

**Layer 2: Organization & Reputation Layer**
- Verified organizations mint non-transferable credential ASAs
- Organizations distribute "Press Pass" tokens to verified members
- Enhanced verification shows "✓ Verified by Reuters" instead of wallet addresses

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Architecture
```python
class VerisignApp(ARC4Contract):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.attestations = BoxMap(Bytes, Attestation, key_prefix=b"a")
    
    @abimethod()
    def attest(self, file_hash: Bytes) -> Attestation:
        # First-to-sign-wins policy
        assert file_hash not in self.attestations, "Content already attested"
        
        new_attestation = Attestation(
            creator_address=Address(Txn.sender),
            timestamp=UInt64(Global.latest_timestamp)
        )
        
        self.attestations[file_hash] = new_attestation.copy()
        return new_attestation
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// ABI-compliant transaction creation
const abiMethod = new algosdk.ABIMethod({
  name: 'attest',
  args: [{ type: 'byte[]', name: 'file_hash' }],
  returns: { type: '(address,uint64)' },
})

const atc = new algosdk.AtomicTransactionComposer()
atc.addMethodCall({
  appID: VERISIGN_APP_ID,
  method: abiMethod,
  methodArgs: [hashBytes],
  sender: senderAddress,
  // ... other params
})
```

### Credential System
```typescript
// Create non-transferable credential ASA
const txn = algosdk.makeAssetCreateTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject({
  sender: creatorAddress,
  total: 1000000,
  decimals: 0,
  freeze: creatorAddress,    // Can prevent transfers
  clawback: creatorAddress,  // Can revoke credentials
  unitName: 'CRED',
  assetName: `${organizationName} Credential`,
})
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ End-to-end signature creation and verification
- ✅ Wallet connection and transaction signing
- ✅ Credential ASA creation and distribution
- ✅ Enhanced verification with organization display
- ✅ Browser extension functionality
- ✅ localStorage persistence across sessions

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path:** Create signature → Verify same file → See verified status
2. **Credential Flow:** Create ASA → Distribute → Sign content → Enhanced verification
3. **Error Handling:** Duplicate attestations, network failures, invalid files
4. **Extension Testing:** Right-click verification on various websites

### Known Limitations
- TestNet only (production would use MainNet)
- Manual credential registry (production needs database)
- Single smart contract (could be modularized)
- Basic error messages (could be more user-friendly)
